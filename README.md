# AMATH 482 - Computational Methods For Data Analysis
This repository contains all of the projects for AMATH482 taught by Jason Bramburger (jbrambur@uw.edu) at the University of Washington - Winter 2021.

### Assignment Descriptions:
- **Assignment #1 - A Submarine Problem** 
*In this paper, we explore a dataset containing acoustic data from the Puget Sound taken over a 24-hour time period in half-hour increments. Our goal is to determine the location and path of a new submarine which emits an unknown acoustic frequency to send our P-8 Poseidon subtracking aircraft to follow the submarine. This is done through the use of the discrete Fourier transform to convert the given data to the frequency domain, averaging the transformed frequency data to determine the frequency signature of the submarine, filtering the data with a Gaussian function around the frequency signature to amplify the submarines signal and diminish any noise, and mapping the submarines path and location with the transformed, denoised data for the aircraft to the follow.*

- **Assignment #2 - Rock & Roll and the Gabor Transform**
*In this paper, we explore a portion of two of the greatest rock and roll songs of all time, Sweet Child O’ Mine by the Guns N’ Roses and Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd, in order to analyze the music signals and identify the notes being played in each song from different instruments. Our aim in this exploration is to demonstrate the usefulness of the Gabor Transform in extracting frequency information from time-varying signals, while preserving information about where those frequencies occur in time. We explore the ideas of oversampling and under-sampling signals, the Fourier Transform, the Gabor Transform, and window functions in this paper - as well as provide directions for future work on this problem.*

- **Assignment #3 - PCA and a Spring-Mass System**
*In this paper, we explore a dataset containing video data from four different oscillation scenarios of a spring-mass system. Each scenario was filmed from three cameras, each in different locations/from different angles. Our goal is to illustrate various aspects of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), its practical usefulness, and the effects of noise on PCA algorithms through performing the PCA method on the given dataset. We explore the ideas of video/image filtering and principal component analysis in this paper - as well as provide directions for future work on this problem and advantages/disadvantages of PCA.*
